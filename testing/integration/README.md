# How to build a Docker Image

General setup:  

 * install docker on your system
 * make an **image** using this directory (`sudo docker build .` -> sha1 identifying image)
 * make a **container** using that image (`sudo docker run <hash-of-image>`)
 * use it to test.
 
 ## (Goo|u)buntu Setup
 * The package is named `docker.io`, not `docker`, which is some random window management dock thing.
 * As above, possibly reading the "help" command sometimes.
