# How to build a Docker Image
  (TODO: Put instructions, or a shell script, here.)

General setup:  

 * install docker on your system
 * make an /image/ using this directory (sudo docker build .)
 * make a /container/ using that image (sudo docker run <hash-of-image>)
 * use it to test.
 
 ## (Goo|u)buntu Setup
 * The package is named =docker.io=, not =docker=, which is some random window management dock thing.
 * As above, possibly reading the "help" command sometimes.
